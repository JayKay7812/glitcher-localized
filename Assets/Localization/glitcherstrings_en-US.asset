    m_Localized: "To: dupree@fwegomail.com\nFrom: anata@fwegomail.com\n\nSubject:
      To The Best\n\nDear Mr. Dupree,\n\nMerry Christmas! I wanted to use this opportunity
      to thank you for my last semester in college, although it was so long ago.
      I have never enjoyed an English class so much in my life before. You were able
      to pull distinct parts of the literature and relate them to us in a way that
      opened our eyes, my eyes at least. Without you, it would not have been possible.
      \n\nOn the first day of class, you walked in quietly yet there was something
      loud in your aura. Perhaps it was your determination in learning with us. You
      told us you had this class many times before, but something different happened
      each time for you. You also said that everyone would learn something for themselves.
      Some would know defeat and give up. Some would go through it half heartedly
      and continue to do so in their life. Those kinds of students, you said, you
      felt sorry for. It seemed like such a daunting way to open a class, the way
      you related it directly to our future lives. A lot of kids dropped your class
      after a week, and I felt sorry for them too.\n\nI must be honest, I was one
      of those half-hearted students in the beginning. But after eight weeks, I realized
      I had to work harder and you had so much to teach us. It was a challenge, reading
      two books for some of our meetings. Maybe that was why I was put off by the
      work initially. Thankfully, your class was a major criteria for my degree so
      that definitely pushed me to work harder. How is it that we finished nine books
      in the course of four months? \n\nMr. Dupree, I\u2019m writing to you now,
      five years late. I know we bumped into each other a year ago at the Whitney
      Museum. Since then, something has been bothering me so much. Seeing you that
      day made me see myself. I started realizing I had not progressed since I was
      in your class. In a way, I have failed you and I have failed myself. You taught
      us to think for ourselves, to honor ourselves, and to find our purpose. I have
      been wasting the last few years and I lost my sense of individuality. I\u2019ve
      thrown myself at the wrong targets. I know it isn\u2019t something you hoped
      to hear from your former students, especially me. I was never supposed to turn
      into one of those students that you felt sorry for. \n\nThe last day of class,
      I stayed behind and we talked for an hour. Then you said to me, \u201CI expect
      great things. Now be gone.\u201D I left with a feeling of confidence, nothing
      could ruin it. But truthfully, I was blinded. Things will change now. I will
      be sure that I, myself, will do great things. I won\u2019t slow down for anyone
      anymore. All the lessons you\u2019ve taught me are coming back to me. And I
      am awake.\n\nThank you with all my heart and Happy Holidays.\n\nAnata Lawliet"
